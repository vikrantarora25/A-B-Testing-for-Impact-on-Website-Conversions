    "### Experiment Description\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead."

    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesized that free trial screener set clearer expectations for students upfront and thus reduce the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time— without significantly reducing the number of students to continue pass the free trial and eventually complete the course."
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "### A/B Test Design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unit of diversion\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***unit of diversion*** is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"metric\"></a>\n",
    "Here two types of metrics are selected for a successful experiment: Invariate and Evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Invariate metircs*** are used for sanity checks or A/A experiment before running the experiment, such as checking if the distributions are the same between control and experiment group, to make sure our experiment is not inherently wrong. Invariant metrics usually have a larger unit of diversion, randomly selected, or happens before the experiment starts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***Evaluation metrics*** are the metrics in which we expect to see a change, and are relevant to the business goals we aim to achieve. For each metric we state a $Dmin$ - which marks the minimum change which is practically significant to the business. **For instance, stating that any increase in net conversion rate that is under 1%, even if statistically significant, is not practical to the business.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invariant Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Invariate Metrics - Sanity Checks <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"invariate\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric Name  | Metric Formula  | $Dmin$  | Notation |\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n",
    "| Number of Cookies in Course Overview Page  | # unique daily cookies on page | 3000 cookies  | $C_k$ |\n",
    "| Number of Clicks on Free Trial Button  | # unique daily cookies who clicked  | 240 clicks | $C_l$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the goal of measurement is how many students will allocate more than 5 hours a week for Udacity courses, which happens before students enrolling in the courses. And thus the clicks and cookies related metircs are for the invariant metircs.User-id, however, will be tracked after enrolling the course,which is not effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are concerned about whether students click the \"free trial\" and if students' clicks for the answer to questions about the number of hours they will devote to the course, and thus clicks and cookies are important. Number of cookies is used to tell whether the change is from the questions or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "Evaluation Metrics - Performance Indicators <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"evaluation\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric Name  | Metric Formula  | $Dmin$  | Notation |\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n",
    "| Gross Conversion   |  $\\frac{enrolled}{C_l}$  | 0.01  | $Conversion_{Gross}$ |\n",
    "| Net Conversion  |  $\\frac{paid}{C_l}$  | 0.0075 | $Conversion_{Net}$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gross Conversion will be a good metric. Gross conversion means the number of enrolled divided by number of clicks. And thus in the experiment group, we hypothesized the number of enrollment will decrease after answering the screener questions, given those who selected <5 hour will not be encouraged to enroll. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Net conversion is number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the ”Start free trial” button. This metric is also necessary because of the same reason described in Retention. If the hypothesis hold true, the number of students who remain enrolled past 14 days won’t change so much. Therefore, this metric also doesn’t change."
